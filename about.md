<p style="text-align:justify">Hi, I'm Jeffrey Adorkor an ambitious Ashesi student who majors in Computer Science. From my time at Ashesi, I have gathered skills in Web Development and I translate these skills into building websites for local businesses and individuals. Apart from web development, I have interests in mobile app development and I am hoping to expand my skills to become a great mobile app developer. When I'm not working, you would find me winding down by playing video games.</p>
